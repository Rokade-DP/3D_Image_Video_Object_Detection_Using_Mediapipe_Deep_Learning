# 3D_Image_Video_Object_Detection_Using_Mediapipe_Deep_Learning
The project involves using the MediaPipe library to perform 3D object detection in images or videos. This includes tasks such as adapting or extending MediaPipe modules for 3D tracking, transforming coordinates for 3D representation, integrating with 3D visualization libraries, and optimizing for real-time processing.
